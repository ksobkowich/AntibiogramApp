### Antibiogram Tab

</center>

#### Overview

The purpose of the 'Antibiogram Tab' is to provide users with a familiar visual for assessing their antimicrobial resistance data. Antibiograms are a commonly generated report that summarizes the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates collected within a specific healthcare setting or community over a given time period. It provides valuable insight into which antibiotics are most effective against prevalent strains of bacteria, helping clinicians and pharmacists select the most appropriate treatment options. By consolidating and analyzing this data, an antibiogram also aids in monitoring antibiotic resistance trends, guiding policy decisions on infection control and antimicrobial stewardship strategies.

#### How to read this figure

-   **Susceptibility Percentage**: Look for higher susceptibility (S) percentages, as these indicate that the antibiotic is effective against most isolates of that organism.

-   **Sample Size**: Check how many isolates were tested for each organism-antibiotic combination; small sample sizes reduce the reliability of the results.

-   **Local Context**: Recognize that resistance patterns vary between regions and facilities. Data in the antibiogram applies best to the facility or area where it was generated.

#### Points of caution

-   **Limited Scope**: An antibiogram provides a broad overview and does not replace individualized testing.

-   **Emerging Resistance**: Bacteria can develop resistance over time; a drug that seemed effective may not remain so.

-   **Clinical Judgement**: Always consider patient-specific factors (e.g., allergies, medical history) rather than relying solely on aggregate data.

#### Data filters

Several filters are available for you to customize the antibiogram. The benefit of this is that you can create "enhanced antibiograms" more specific to a particular case or scenario-of-interest. These filters can be used to create antibiograms specific to patient, clinic or region-level factors. Note that as you apply more filters, the sample size will be reduced, potentially leading to less accurate estimates.

#### Plot controls

On this page, we have provided you with several plot controls that can be used to modify the overall layout and/or presentation of the antibiogram.
